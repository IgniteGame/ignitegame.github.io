  <p>We are a bunch of close friends who recently graduated university with a dream to make a game and share it with the world. We're fond of all things board, card, and tabletop, and we all love creating and designing. Several of us have been designing board games together since middle school, and to release a board game to the world has been our childhood dream. We wanted to take this simple passion of ours and develop a game that everyone could easily pick up and play. Please help us make our dream a reality. From all of us, thank you!</p>
